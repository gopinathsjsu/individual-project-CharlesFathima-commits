# Individual Project Charles Fathima. B


The Credit Card App, created using Java, uses methods based on various design patterns to figure out what type of credit card is given based on the information provided. It's a flexible app that can handle different types of files like CSV, JSON, and XML for storing records. It carefully reads these files, makes sure the credit card numbers are real, and then creates the instances for the right kind of credit card.

Inside these files, there's all sorts of credit card info, like the cardholder's name, credit card number, and when it expires.

This app uses three special techniques: one for going through data efficiently, one for picking the best way to do things, and one for making new credit card instances for each correct credit card types easily.

All these tricks together make the app very flexible and strong, so it's really good at handling credit card information in an intelligent manner.

## Steps to run:

- To run the application, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Open the project in Visual Studio Code(or IntelliJ-my suggestion).
- Place the input files in the /ProjectFiles/src/inputs directory.
- Build the project and execute the Client.java file(while executing in InelliJ, give the input and output files using edit configuration for the application".
- During execution, enter the names of the input and output files.
- The relevant output file will be generated in the /ProjectFiles/src/outputs folder.
